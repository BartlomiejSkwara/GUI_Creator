# GUI - Creator

This project is created for the purpose of creating graphical interface that would help
me in creating user interfaces for my programs quickly.

I just find it very annoying that i have to recompile every few minutes just to check if i should move an object even  more to the right    
or maybe  somewhere else :>

## Used libraries

Dear ImGui:
https://github.com/eliasdaler/imgui-sfml

Dear ImGui backend for use with SFML:
https://github.com/eliasdaler/imgui-sfml

(Later on i wish to replace Dear ImGui with UI generated by this app, but currently it still lacks some features)

SFML:
https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php

(I also plan to replace SFML with SDL or OpenGL)


## Roadmap

- Redesigning some problematic classes :>  ✔

- Observer based object interaction system ✔

- Support for planned object types (imgbuttons, images, normal text) **(wip)**

- Saving and exporting designed interface
