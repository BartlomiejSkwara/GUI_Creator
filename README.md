# GUI - Creator
The main goal of this project is creating an app that would help
me in quickly designing user interfaces for my programs.

I just find it very annoying that i have to recompile every few minutes just to check if i should move an object even  more to the right    
or maybe  somewhere else :>

## Used libraries

Dear ImGui:
https://github.com/eliasdaler/imgui-sfml

Dear ImGui backend for use with SFML:
https://github.com/eliasdaler/imgui-sfml

(Later on i am going to replace Dear ImGui with UI generated by this app, but currently it  lacks some features)

SFML:
https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php

(I also plan to replace SFML with SDL or OpenGL)
